## Description

This project is all about the deployment of a microservices-based application called [sockshop](https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo/blob/master/deploy/kubernetes/helm-chart/values.yaml) using modern approach that emphasized automation and efficiency.

### Project objective
The primary goal is to use infrastructure as code tool for rapid and reliable deployment to kubernetes through a CI/CD pipeline.

### Tools and technologies used
- **Jenkins** for creating a CI/CD pipeline
- **Terraform** for writing and configuring infrastructure
- **Ansible Vault** for encrypting sensitive data which provide the application with extra layer of security
- **Prometheus** for monitoring and alerting using AlertManager
- **AWS account** with the necessary permissions to allow us deploy the sock shop kubernetes cluster on AWS EKS(Elastic Kubernetes Service)
